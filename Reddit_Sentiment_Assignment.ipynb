Until finally, i saved up enough money for a knockoff aliexpress Jayson Tatum jersey.\\n\\nWhen gameday came, I waited anxiously outside for the players to arrive. I saw the bus pull up, and my heart skipped beats. Tatum finally stepped off and everyone cheered. I pushed my way to the front and thrust my jersey out with a marker, yelling Tatum! Tatum! Please sign!\\n\\nHe looked at me, smiled, and took the jersey from my hand. We almost touched as he pulled away(!) He took the marker and began writing. I was near tears.

    "\n",
    "'This is not a bad thing.'\n",

    "An easier method is to use a slightly-improved sentiment analysis technique, such as TextBlob or VADER (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) in Python.  Both libraries use a hand-coded algorithm with word scores like AFINN, but also with additions like negation rules (e.g. a word after 'not' has it's score reversed).\n",

    "The stretch goal is to use other sentiment analysis libraries on the Reddit data we collected, and compare the various approaches (AFINN word-by-word, TextBlob, and VADER) using plots and statistics.  For the AFINN word-by-word approach, you will need to either sum up the sentiment scores for each comment, or average them.  You might also divide them by 5 to get the values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief example of getting scores from the 3 methods described above.  We can see while the raw AFINN approach gives a score of -0.6 (if normalized), TextBlob shows 0.35 and VADER shows 0.43."
